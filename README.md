# Dream Run

 An arcade style game I made in high school for my AP Computer Science class. 
 
 ## Controls
 
 The only key the user uses is the space bar, which is generally used to jump from a platform
 
 ### Cases:

    On a Platform: Causes the player to jump

    Falling after a jump: Dabs (does nothing)

    Falling after a jump with 2 peppers or 2 ice creams collected consequtively: Call in helper and jump

    Falling after a jump while riding elephant: Expels the elephant allowing you to do another jump

## Objectives

    Try to reach the maximum score by 1) avoiding enemies, if they touch you, its game over and 2) collecting peppers to increase your score multiplier. The score multiplier determines the amount of points added to your score for every platform that appears. Beware, eating peppers increases the pace of the game, so eat ice cream to slow down the pace.

Hope you enjoy this game!
